# :pencil: MyNotes
**MyNotes** is a Demo app which demonstrates the use of MVVM architecture, Dependency Injection, Navigation Component Library, Room Database, LiveData, Coroutines, Datastore and other **Modern Android Development** Practices.

# üó°Ô∏è Dependency Injection
The project uses [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for Dependency Injection :syringe: 

I highly recommend to start with Manual Dependency injection method and then move to Hilt, see branch [***`di-ManualInjection`***](https://github.com/avidraghav/MyNotes/tree/di-ManualInjection) for implementation.

- To Implement DI with Hilt see  [***`di-hilt`***](https://github.com/avidraghav/MyNotes/tree/di-hilt)
# :wrench: Built With
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Programming Language Used in the app.
- [Navigation Component Library](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - For setting up app's navigation.
- [Room Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - For persisting data/tasks in device's local storage.
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) - To execute code asynchronously.
- [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - In the simplest of ways consider this as a pipe through which the data flows in the app, by using flow
   a developer doesn't need to refresh variables which contain data.  
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Used to observe the data on the UI layer
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - To Store UI-related data that isnt destroyed on UI changes.
- [RecylerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview) - To Display data in a list format.
- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - For Dependency Injection
- [Datastore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) - For Storing Data

 see [***`feature/Prefernces-Datastore`***](https://github.com/avidraghav/MyNotes/tree/feature/Prefernces-Datastore) to Implement Preferences Datastore by following Abstraction


# :white_check_mark: Tests

- For Implementing Instrumented Test Cases for Room Database see branch [***`testing`***](https://github.com/avidraghav/MyNotes/tree/testing)
- For Implementing Unit Test Cases for ViewModel see branch [***`Tests-For-ViewModel`***](https://github.com/avidraghav/MyNotes/tree/Tests-For-ViewModel)
